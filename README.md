# SG-resale
<em><b> A project on SG resale flat prices </b></em>

For this project, I used the dataset found on kaggle on SG resale flat prices from the year 1990 - 1999 (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teyang/singapore-hdb-flat-resale-prices-19902020).

Using MYSQL to do data cleansing and data transformation for it to be viable as to showcase as a visualization via PowerBI.

The project showcase one aspect of Singapore flat resale price based on one dataset file (1990-1999) in the various dataset which covers 1990 - 2020. Reason for selecting one dataset over the rest is due to the year I was born falls within this range and it was also the year I shifted over into my current flat with my family.

Another analysic will be done in future for the whole complete dataset of 1990-2021.

Both the MYSQL code and PowerBI dashboard can be seen attached.
